var lice=`<p>Just the thought of lice makes most people shiver. Head lice are teeny tiny parasites that live on the scalp and hair shafts where they dine on blood. Nearly ten million school children are diagnosed with lice each year. Lice can be contracted by coming in contact with an infected person through play, sports, school or wearing clothing of someone who has the parasite. <br>
Because they reproduce so quickly, it is very difficult to get rid of lice. There are a number of kits and products on the market that can eradicate the lice but they are also loaded with chemicals. The main ingredient in all of these shampoos and kits is permethrin – a very dangerous and toxic substance that should never be placed near the scalp – especially a child’s scalp.<br></p>

        <p>Although lice are not actually vampires, using this ancient remedy against the undead can also get rid of a lice infestation. Garlic is one of the home remedies for lice that is a terribly smelly option, but make a paste with 8 to 10 garlic cloves and a few teaspoons of lime juice. Spread on the scalp and leave the paste on for a half an hour. Shampoo to clean. The intense smell is believed to kill the live lice and their nits. This treatment should be repeated weekly for one or two months.

        <p>The combination of salt and vinegar applied to the scalp is believed to be one of the better home remedies for lice for several reasons: First, the salt dehydrates the lice while the vinegar kills young lice and nits. Although it will not kill adult lice, the vinegar is believed to loosen the "glue" that allows lice to hold tight to hair strands. This method is especially effective when combined with thorough combing.<br>

One caveat for the use of petroleum jelly, however, is that it is very resistant to cleansers. If you do apply petroleum jelly to the scalp and hair in order to kill lice and nits, it may take several passes with a harsh dish detergent in order to remove all of the residue from your hair. Petroleum jelly may be a better option for those with very short hairstyles.<br>

        <br><h3>Coconut Oil</h3><br>
        <p>Coconut oil is another one of the home remedies for lice via the smothering technique, and because it's more of a solid matter than mayo or tea tree oil, it's easier to spread onto the hair. (Bonus: It has a pleasant, tropical smell). Many households now stock coconut oil for a wide variety of uses including cooking and moisturizing. If you don't have any in stock, visit any major grocery store. In addition to smothering the lice, coconut oil traps them on the head and keeps them from jumping to other people's heads or any other surface where they can live and perpetuate.<br>

var lips=` <p>Dryness and peeling skin on the lips can get a bit annoying. And when we complain to our dear mothers about it, they ask us to stop licking our lips every other minute. The best way to prevent this problem is by providing the lips with the hydration and nourishment we have been depleting them of.<br>

Before we get into the wonderful home remedies you can use for chapped lips, here’s something you should know. Water is an essential part of any beauty regimen. It helps to keep your body and skin well hydrated. No matter how many remedies or lip balms you use, if you do not drink enough water, your chapped lips are going to keep coming back. So, first and foremost, drink plenty of water during the day and use the remedies given in this article for faster results.<br>

var sleep=`<p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that is characterized by staying asleep or difficulty in falling asleep. This results in fatigue, poor performance, tension headaches, irritability, depression and various other problems. If you have been awake until 2 AM, then you are suffering with insomnia. It is one of the least-understood sleep disorders. Adults need an average of 8-9 hours of sleep daily at night, otherwise one might feel miserable and will end up tossing and turning in bed.<br>
Let's have a look at the top 11 Indian home remedies for insomnia.</p><br><br>

<h3>1.Take A Hot Bath</h3>
<p>Taking a hot shower two hours before going to bed can be of great help in treating insomnia. A study found out that women with insomnia who took a hot bath for about 90 minutes slept much better than those who didn't. A hot bath relaxes your body and soothes the nerve endings.<br>Add a few drops of soothing essential oils like chamomile, rosemary or lavender oil to the bath water.</p>
 
<h3>2. Apple cider Vinegar</h3>
<p>Apple cider vinegar has amino acids that relieve fatigue. It also helps in breaking down the fatty acids that release tryptophan. This will regulate a proper sleep cycle.<br> Mix 2 teaspoons each of apple cider vinegar and honey in a glass of warm water.<br> Drink this mixture before going to sleep.</p>

<h3>3.Fenugreek Water </h3>
<p>Drinking fenugreek water every day will not only help the body to function properly but will also promote better sleep. Fenugreek is known to reduce insomnia, anxiety and dizziness. <br>Soak a teaspoon of fenugreek seeds in a bowl of water. Leave it overnight. <br>Strain this water and drink it daily.</p>

Interestingly, it has been found that women (more than men), adolescents, and those with a family history of mouth ulcers are at higher risk of developing mouth ulcers. The good news is that they are easily treatable.  Stock your home with these natural home remedies for mouth ulcers. </p>

var teeth= `<p>The enamel and dentin is what play the biggest role in color. Certain food and drinks will directly stain the enamel, yes, but over time the two biggest culprits are the nasty food and drink that actually break down the enamel, and weakening enamel as we age. As the enamel breaks down, it reveals the yellow dentin underneath. These remedies will focus on whitening teeth that have already lost some white enamel, but it’s also good to keep in mind that doing things to strengthen enamel is just as important so you can keep it from breaking down further. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure (or whitening!)
</p>
<h3>1. Baking Soda and Lemon Juice Paste</h3>
<p>Baking Soda isn’t a shocker here. Sodium bicarbonate (its official name) is mildly abrasive; gently scrubbing away surface stains to return teeth to a whiter shade. It’s also very alkaline (the opposite of acidic) so I would think if you have a very acidic mouth or eat a lot of acidic food, it could help balance out the Ph, which would be useful as acid breaks down enamel-this is strictly speculation on my part. It will also reduce the acidity of the lemon juice, which acts as a natural bleach of sorts. I use a mixture of baking soda and water on some days, and use the lemon juice on others, as I don’t want to overdo it.<br>

<strong>You will need…</strong><br>
-Several teaspoons of baking soda<br>
-Enough lemon juice or water to form a paste<br>
-A toothbrush<br>

<strong>Directions</strong><br>
Mix several teaspoons of baking soda with enough fresh lemon juice (or water) to make a paste. Wipe your teeth and any extra saliva off of them with a paper towel. Put a good amount of paste onto your toothbrush and apply.<br>

Leave the paste on for 1 minute, then rinse, so as to avoid the acid effecting enamel. If you are using just water you can leave it on for up to 3 minutes.<br>

<h3>2. Strawberry, Salt and Baking Soda Scrub<?h3><br>
<p>Strawberries are high in Vitamin C, which can help break-down plaque that is causing your teeth to look yellow. It also has an enzyme called malic acid, which may help to remove surface stains. The salt acts as an abrasive portion of the paste, physically scrubbing away stain-causing gunk, and the baking soda is an extra touch that you can choose to leave out if you’d prefer (I just like to add it to anything involving my teeth.)<br>

<strong>You will need…</strong><br>
-1-3 large strawberries<br>
-A pinch of seat salt<br>
-1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (optional)<br>

<strong>Directions</strong><br>
Mash the berries into a pulp, and add a pinch of sea salt and ½ teaspoon of baking soda, if you’re using it. Wipe any extra saliva off your teeth with a paper towel, and then apply a generous portion of the mixture to a toothbrush and apply. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then rinse. Do this nightly.<br>

<h3>3. Coconut Oil Rinse</h3><br>
<p>I know this sounds absolutely mad (I thought it was crazy too when I first read about it) but rinsing your mouth with coconut oil (called ‘oil pulling’) is a unique, old, remedy that people swear by to help whiten teeth. It doesn’t sound like the most pleasant thing in the world, but I actually don’t mind the taste, and I think it does make a difference in the color of your teeth. It won’t make a difference by “bleaching” per say, but lauric acid in coconut oil can rid your teeth of bacteria found in plaque that can make them yellow. It is also supposed to promote gum health, and help keep your breath fresh.<br>

<strong>You will need…</strong><br>
-About a tablespoon of coconut oil<br>

<strong>Directions</strong><br>
In the morning, before you brush your teeth, scoop out a tablespoon or a little less (depending on the size of your mouth) of coconut oil. You can either soften it, or just put it in your mouth (I usually do the latter, and just let it soften.) Push, swish, and “pull” the oil through and around your teeth for 10-15 minutes, then spit it out, rinse with water, and brush your teeth.<br>
